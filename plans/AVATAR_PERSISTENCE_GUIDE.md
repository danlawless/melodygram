# Avatar Persistence Guide

## ✨ Problem Solved: Sticky Avatar Selection

Previously, when you refreshed the page, you had to select your avatar image again. Now your avatar choice persists across page refreshes!

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. **Dual Storage System**
- **Avatar History**: Stored in session storage (`melodygram_avatar_history`)
- **Current Selection**: Stored in local storage (`melodygram_creation_session`)

### 2. **What Gets Saved**
- **Current Avatar URL**: The URL of your selected avatar
- **Avatar Index**: Which avatar in your history is currently selected
- **Session Context**: All your other creation data (lyrics, title, vocal, etc.)

### 3. **What Gets Restored**
- **On Page Load**: Your selected avatar image appears automatically
- **History Sync**: The ImageUpload component finds the matching avatar in history
- **Navigation**: Avatar navigation buttons show the correct current position

## 🎯 User Experience

### ✅ **Before the Fix**
- Generate/upload avatar ✅
- Refresh page ❌
- Avatar gone, have to pick again 😞

### ✅ **After the Fix**
- Generate/upload avatar ✅ 
- Refresh page ✅
- Avatar still selected! 🎉

## 🔍 Technical Implementation

### CreationStudio.tsx Changes:
- **Save**: `currentAvatarUrl` and `currentAvatarIndex` in session
- **Restore**: Set `generatedImageUrl` and `currentAvatarIndex` on mount
- **Sync**: Updated dependency array to save when avatar changes

### ImageUpload.tsx Changes:
- **Match**: Find restored avatar URL in avatar history  
- **Set Current**: Automatically set as current avatar
- **Sync**: Keep internal state consistent with external props

## 🎵 Benefits

1. **Seamless Workflow**: Never lose your avatar selection
2. **Better UX**: No need to re-select after page refresh
3. **Consistent State**: Avatar history and selection stay in sync
4. **Smart Restoration**: Only restores valid, non-expired avatar URLs

## 📱 Works Everywhere

Your avatar now sticks like it should! 🎭✨
