# MelodyGram - Project Plan & Technical Overview
*Transform Your Pictures Into Personalized Singing Experiences*

## ðŸŽµ Project Overview

MelodyGram is an innovative AI-powered platform that combines music generation with animated talking avatars to create personalized singing experiences. Users upload a picture and lyrics, then our system generates a custom song and brings their photo to life as a singing avatar.

**The Magic Formula:** Picture + Lyrics = Singing Avatar with Custom Song

## ðŸ”„ Technical Implementation Flow

### 1. Content Creation Workflow
```
User Upload â†’ Mureka API â†’ LemonSlice API â†’ Final Output
     â†“            â†“             â†“              â†“
  Image +      Generate      Create         Deliver
  Lyrics       Song          Avatar         Result
```

### 2. API Integration Sequence
1. **Load initial data** from Mureka:
   ```javascript
   GET /v1/music/refs          // Load reference tracks library
   GET /v1/music/vocals        // Load available singer profiles
   GET /v1/music/moods-and-genres  // Load available options
   ```

2. **User submits** image + lyrics + preferences + reference + singer
3. **Call Mureka API** to generate song:
   ```javascript
   POST /v1/song/generate
   {
     "lyrics": "user lyrics",
     "genre": "pop",
     "mood": "happy",
     "tempo": 120,
     "reference_track_id": "ref_123",  // Optional reference
     "singer_profile_id": "en-US-sarah", // Selected singer
     "language": "en"
   }
   ```
4. **Poll for completion** using task ID
5. **Call LemonSlice API** with image + generated audio:
   ```javascript
   POST /api/avatar/create
   {
     "image": "base64_image",
     "audio": "audio_file_url",
     "language": "en"
   }
   ```
6. **Stream result** to user in real-time

### 3. Data Flow Architecture
```
Frontend (React/Next.js)
    â†•
Backend API (Node.js/Python)
    â†•
External APIs (Mureka + LemonSlice)
    â†•
Database (User content, metadata)
    â†•
File Storage (Images, audio, videos)
```
